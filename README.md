## About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal workbook for honing my JavaScript programming skills, particularly in the realm of algorithms and data structures. You'll find solutions to problems from various platforms such as (but not limited to):

* **LeetCode**
* **HackerRank**
* **CodeWars**
* **Advent of Code**
* **Interview preparation guides**

Each problem typically includes:
* The problem statement (or a link to it).
* My solution code.
* (Optional) Explanations of the thought process, alternative approaches, and time/space complexity analysis.

## How to Navigate

Each problem solution is typically housed in its own directory, named descriptively. Inside each directory, you'll usually find:

* `index.js` or `solution.js`: The main JavaScript file containing the problem solution.
* `README.md`: A small README specific to the problem, often including the problem description, test cases, and sometimes detailed explanations.
* `test.js` (optional): Unit tests for the solution, if applicable.

To view a solution, simply navigate to the respective directory.

```bash
# Example: Navigating to the Two Sum problem
cd two-sum
